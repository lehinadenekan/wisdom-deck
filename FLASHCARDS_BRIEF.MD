Project Title: Yoruba Proverb Flashcards – Physical & Digital Design

Purpose:
Create a visually appealing, culturally respectful flashcard set featuring Yoruba proverbs. Each card will educate users on Yoruba culture through proverb presentation, translation, and meaning.

🔹 Flashcard Structure
Card Front (Obverse):

Resolution: 300 DPI (dots per inch)

Dimensions:

1500 x 2100 pixels (for 5" x 7" at 300 DPI)

Include a matching full-scene illustration that visually represents the proverb.

Card Back (Reverse):

Display:

Include background elements that continue or extend the scene from the front but less detailed—more like complementary scenery or shadows of main elements.

🔹 Design Guidelines
Theme: Educational and cultural, with a respectful and celebratory tone of Yoruba heritage.

Color Scheme: Use colors inspired by Yoruba art, textiles, and natural tones.

Illustration Style: Artistic, storybook-quality, culturally rooted. Avoid cartoonish or overly modern visuals.

Consistency: All cards should maintain a uniform style and layout for ease of use and visual harmony.

🔹 Required Elements per Card
Front:

Yoruba proverb text

Full-scene illustration

Arabic numeral (bottom right)
