## 3. Quality Assurance & Testing Pipeline

A comprehensive testing and CI pipeline has been established to ensure code quality, performance, and security.

### 3.1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing - **RECENTLY IMPROVED**

- **Framework:** Playwright for browser automation
- **Configuration:** `playwright.config.ts` with:
  - **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3001` (configurable via `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` env var)
  - **Web Server:** Auto-starts dev server with `npm run dev`
  - **Timeout:** 120-second server startup timeout
- **Tests:** Located in `tests/example.spec.ts`
- **Accessibility Testing:**
  - **Framework:** `@axe-core/playwright` for comprehensive accessibility audits
  - **Graduated Approach:** Focuses on critical violations first with detailed logging
  - **Thresholds:** Allows up to 5 critical violations on Word Master page, 3 on Proverbs page
  - **Results:** Dramatically improved from 219 violations to just 2 total violations
- **Navigation Testing:** Robust selectors and enhanced waiting strategies
- **Test Script:** `npx playwright test`
- **Dependencies:** `@playwright/test`, `@axe-core/playwright`, `@stripe/stripe-js`

### 3.2. Unit & Component Testing

- **Framework:** Jest with `ts-jest` for TypeScript support
- **Library:** React Testing Library for rendering and interacting with components
- **Configuration:**
  - `jest.config.js`: Main Jest configuration
  - `jest.setup.js`: Extends Jest with `jest-dom` matchers and sets up the MSW server
- **API Mocking:** Mock Service Worker (`msw`) is used to mock API endpoints
- **Accessibility:** `jest-axe` is integrated to run accessibility checks on components during unit tests
- **Test Script:** `npm test`

### 3.3. Linting & Static Analysis

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** ESLint with the `eslint-config-next` preset
- **CSS:** Stylelint with configurations for standard CSS and Tailwind CSS
- **Type Checking:** A dedicated `tsconfig.typecheck.json` is used for strict, no-emit type checks
- **Scripts:**
  - `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint
  - `npm run lint:css`: Runs Stylelint
  - `npm run typecheck`: Runs the strict TypeScript checker

### 3.4. Performance & Bundle Analysis

- **Bundle Size:** `@next/bundle-analyzer` is integrated
- **Usage:** Run `npm run analyze` to build the project and view an interactive treemap of the JavaScript bundle sizes

### 3.5. Security & Dependency Checks

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** `npm audit` is used to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Script:** `npm run audit` runs the check for high-severity issues

### 3.6. Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Workflow:** Defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Triggers:** Runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch
- **Jobs:** The workflow automates all the checks mentioned above
- **Important Note:** The CI pipeline is tightly scoped to the application source code
